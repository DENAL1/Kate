                <p><h3>Winter/Spring Immersion Dates 2020 (February 10 - April 26)<p>Studio open for observation / enrollment in Immersion January 13 - February 7</h3><h4><a href="mailto:almusic@cruzio.com">Contact Kate</a> to set up a time.</h4></p>
                <p>It has taken me years to develop a method for introducing students to the Suzuki Method; it is very rewarding and well worth the investment of your time. This process educates both the parent and child thoroughly, so that when your child begins lessons, he experiences success, excellence, and joy from the very beginning.</p>
                <p>A document with more information about what observation looks like is linked <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Observation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and below.</p>
                <p>The immersion program comprises 4 weeks of observing private and group lessons, and 6 weeks of short lessons. A sample schedule is linked <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ImmersionSchedule.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and below.<!--, as well as a description of the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ImmersionDescription.pdf" target="_blank">program requirements.</a>--></p>
                <p>After you and your child have completed the Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class, you will be eligible to enroll for lessons. Enrollment is a 45 minute session in which we discuss your and your child's experience so far. Please note that the child does not attend. I answer any questions you have, and we go over the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a>, <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ParentResponsibilities.pdf" target="_blank">parent responsibilities</a>, and <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/CampusRules.pdf" target="_blank">campus rules</a> at the Peace United Church campus where I conduct lessons. Cost: $45. I have included those documents below as well so you can take your time with them over the course of the immersion program. However, please do read them prior to our 45-minute meeting!</p>
