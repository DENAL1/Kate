                <p>Warrior Media was founded to help the people live a healthier and happier life. Our main goal, what we call, "The Million Member Mission" is to get 1,000,000 people to commit to transforming their health through choosing to be a member of one of our health brands. By doing this, we will create a profitable company while also positively impacting the world for the better.</p>
                <p>When people ask us what we do, it's often hard to describe. So... in a nutshell, we are a health publishing company with a focus on using cutting edge technology and content based marketing to create brands that will help people transform their bodies and lives!</p>
                <p>Our goal is to disrupt the publishing industry by changing the publishing paradigm from signing a book deal and distributing and marketing a person's ideas until the public moves on, to creating a lasting community around the people and ideas we choose to publish.</p>
                <p>At Warrior Media we not only build books, we build video courses, create high value membership programs, host live events and even curate high level coaching. Then... we make our brand known through content marketing on our own websites and using the most current social media platforms.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to do everything from start to finish so we can ensure that the people and ideas we select to publish last the test of time. Bottom line is... we're trying to build communities that positively affect the world!</p>
