            <h2>1. Collection of Information</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Survey Information</h3>
            <p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites collects information from individuals by various methods, including,
                but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites
                survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys,
                order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein,
                "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means
                by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones,
                and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or a third party
                (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated
                websites, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including

                it's associated websites may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses
                that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely
                voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Warrior Media, Inc. and
                it's associated websites or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Warrior Media, Inc.
                and it's associated websites or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Warrior Media,
                Inc. and it's associated websites.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Other Information</h3>
            <p>Other occasions when Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites obtain information from individuals include
                (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Warrior
                Media, Inc. and it's associated websites or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance
                through Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites customer service department, and (3) when an individual
                voluntarily subscribes to a Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites service or newsletter (together,
                "Other Information").</p>
            <h3>1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology</h3>
            <p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate
                certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.
                Additionally, Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites may use other new and evolving sources of
                information in the future (together, "Technology Information").
            </p>
            <h3>(a) Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Warrior
                Media, Inc. and it's associated websites to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that
                resides in Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites database. You may read more about cookies at
                http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of
                the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
            <h3>(b) Web Beacons</h3>
            <p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming
                function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's
                unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with
                previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Warrior Media, Inc. and it's
                associated websites to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine
                products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing
                purposes. For example, Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites might place, with the consent of
                a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where clothing products are sold. When Amy,
                an individual listed in Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites database, visits the clothing website,
                Warrior Media, Inc. receives notice by means of the web beacon that Amy visited the Clothing site, and Warrior
                Media, Inc. would then update Amy's profile with the information that Amy is interested in clothing. Warrior
                Media, Inc. may thereafter present offers of clothing related products and services to Amy. In addition to
                using web beacons on web pages, Warrior Media, Inc. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals
                listed in Warrior Media, Inc. database.
            </p>
            <h3>(c) New Technology</h3>
            <p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Warrior
                Media, Inc. and it's associated websites use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Warrior Media,
                Inc. strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
            <h3>1.4 Outside Information</h3>
            <p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites may receive information about individuals from third parties
                or from other sources of information outside of Warrior Media, Inc. including information located in public
                databases ("Outside Information").</p>
            <h3>1.5 Individual Information</h3>
            <p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information,

                information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.

                to third parties. Warrior Media, Inc. has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online
                Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
            <h3>1.7 Credit Card Information</h3>
            <p>Warrior Media, Inc. and it's associated websites may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related
                information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places

                information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Warrior Media, Inc. will use the
                Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit
