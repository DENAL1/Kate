                <p>Thank you for the privilege of working with you and your child. Please read through this information. We will be reviewing it, as well as the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Tuition17-18.pdf" target="_blank">Dates Handout</a> and the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/ParentResponsibilities.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Responsibilities Handout</a> at your child's first September lesson. As you know, if you have had more than a year or so of piano with me, this important conference also serves to refresh our mutual understanding of your daughter's or son's needs and aspirations at the piano.</p> 
                <p>By paying tuition you receive the following (in addition to a lifetime of benefits!): Weekly group lesson, weekly private lesson, 5 or 6 yearly recitals/events, All Studio Class (approximately 5), Ensemble opportunities, Opportunity to sign up to perform on one of the three to five Music Teacher's Association of California, Santa Cruz Branch Recitals, participate in MTAC programs, and opportunity to participate and attend the Suzuki Bay Area Piano Graduation Recitals.</p>
                <p>I often may teach a lesson a little longer than the time agreed to, and I occasionally teach the lesson a little shorter than time allotted. This is according to the needs of your child. You are paying for the overall positive and nurturing musical growth of your child. You are not paying by the minute. By agreeing to the studio policy you agree to allow me to end and begin the lesson as I perceive necessary, and you agree that observing a lesson ending a little late (into your lesson time) is a valuable and important part of lessons. When I accept your tuition payment, I have your understanding that I work with the best interest of your child at heart and I work in good faith with utmost respect for your sacrifice of time and financial commitment.</p>
                <p><strong>Communication</strong><br>
                1 lesson each in September and in May is largely devoted to reviewing together the current policy and to evaluating your child’s needs. <strong>Email</strong> is the appropriate way to keep me in the loop about trading times with other families. <strong>Phone Call</strong> is the appropriate way to alert me about that day's unplanned absence (227-7535). <strong>In person</strong> at the lesson is the appropriate way to discuss any concerns or questions about your child's progress or any permanent scheduling changes. If you have had problems practicing well with your child, for example, or you want to express important information about your child's needs, please mention this to me at the beginning of the lesson and we will discuss it then or at the end. In most cases, if you feel you need privacy from your child, you can simply ask your child to wait outside.</p>
                <p><strong>Absences</strong><br>
                I do take sick leave, which is two Weeks between September and May with no makeup. Each week includes both a private and a group lesson. Up to 2 more weeks' sick leave will be credited in lesson credit to the Summer (this complements my summer policy of my suspended sick leave and of leniency - credit to Fall - for up to 2 of your missed lessons).</p>
                <p>Child's lesson is made up only in case of illness. Please do not hesitate to cancel if your child is ill. This is in everyone’s best interest. In the case of an absence, I do not offer make-ups or refunds; however, you may trade times with any other student to make up for lost lessons. You may ask me if I have extra slots available (from other students who can not use their time) for make up, however, I can not keep you on the roster for lessons for more than 3 months.</p>
                <p><strong>Friday Lesson Policy</strong><br>
                Those of you with a Friday lesson are subject, as arranged, to rescheduling on All Studio Class Days. The group classes will be replaced by the ASC/ If you want to attend an additional group class on those weeks please look over the Weekly Schedule and pick a duo that includes students at the same book level as your child.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I sometimes have planned absences due to family obligations. On those planned absence days, we reschedule, usually to a Monday, but as convenient to you, and the lesson may be at the studio or at your home. As a courtesy, for each of my planned absences I entitle you to a planned absence as well -at your discretion , and also rescheduled to your convenience.</p>
                <p><strong>Device Policy</strong><br>
                Please only allow siblings to play on or use a device if they are out of the room, at the picnic table.</p>
                <p>If you are the practice parent: <strong>NO TEXTING.</strong>This is a distraction to me, to your child, and, of course, to you! It undermines the Suzuki Triangle that we are striving for. If you are taking notes on your phone, I hope that, while it is usually obvious to me, that you still might mention that to me or remind me of that.</p>
                <p>IF, as the practice parent, taking notes, you find that you simply can not get through this precious half hour without texting, due to an emergency, please remove yourself from the room while texting.</p>
                <p>IF you are sitting by arrangement at the back of the room, (Likely your child is in 6th grade or higher), then it is fine for you to be texting just as it is fine for you to be reading or working.</p>
